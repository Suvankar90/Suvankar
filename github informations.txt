Git is a tool & revision control system to mange your source code history.
But Github is a hosting service for Git repositories.

GITHub is a company which allows us to host a central repository in a remote server..

In GITHUB new repository is for for both GIT & GITHuB..
GIT allows you to create a local repository for the projects you work on but GITHUB allows us to create an crentral repository 
which is used to store your projects data.

* Repository is a storage space for your project.
* commit is record changes to one or more files in your branch..GIT Assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or
hash,that identifies the specific changes.

* Version control system is a software that helps an developer team to control and manage (track) all the changes have
been made to source code and also maintin some other infomations like who has made the changes & what changes have been
made

* Types of version control system
  1)Centralized version control system (CVCS), Eg : SVN,TFT,CVS
  2) Distributed version control system (DVCS) Eg : GIT,GITHUB
* Staging is a logical sepration of codes which are not required while developing
